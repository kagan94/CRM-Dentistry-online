# Welcome to my project - CRM "Dentistry online".
This system was created for a dental center to record specific information about visitors.

To develop it, I used Yii(1.x), PHP, AJAX, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, MySQL, XML, and other technologies.

**Main features of this system are:**
* Managing users' profiles
* Add/Edit/Delete information about patients/affiliates/doctors/discounts/Sources of clients/Services
* Provide statistics on patients' visits (taking into account a number of visits of certain patient)
* Schedule (to appoint a new visit as soon as possible for doctor)
